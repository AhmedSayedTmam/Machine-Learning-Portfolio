## by Ahmed Sayed 


## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.
>Actually a lot of variables and informaton that allowed me to have a good chance to look deeper at factors that affect the the current status of the loan: Cancelled, Chargedoff, Completed, Current, Defaulted, FinalPaymentInProgress, PastDue.
>These features, helped me through my invstigation, LoanStatus, BorrowerRate, ProsperScore, EmploymentStatus, MonthlyLoanPayment, LoanOriginalAmount
>Finally I could find these observations through my invstigation
>> Most of the loans are current or completed 
>> Most of the borrowers are employed
>> Lot of loans is with small montly payments
>> Highest Borrower Rate are asscociated with loans that are charged-off
>> Highest Prosper Score when a loan is completed
>> The employment status has no impact on the loan outcome
>> The loans with current status have in average a higher Monthly Loan Payment
>> The loans with current status have in average a higher orginal loan amount
>> The higher the Prosper Score, the lower the interest rate, so borrower with a low Prosper Score get a higher interest rate and the higher Prosper Score when a loan is completed
>> Borrowers with a high Prosper score have higher monthly payments and higher monthly loan payments are more common in loans that are current.
## Key Insights for Presentation

>For the presentation, I just focus on  the influence of Borrower Rate, Monthly Loan Payment and the loan status into  borrowers risk (ProsperScore) . I am going to start by introducing the loan status variable, followed by its relationship with Borrower Rate, Monthly Loan Payment and borrowers risk (ProsperScore).

>To analyze the relationships mentioned above, I decided to use box plots and  the violin plots because they provide all the statistical information required throughout this project.
